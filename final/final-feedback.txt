PART 1:
Nice work

PART 2:
Great

PART 3:
Great!

PART 4:
This works, but you're ultimately doing a lot of extra steps.  Rather than iterating through your output structure, I would suggest trying to built it directly using Pandas methods.  To get the start/end dates, you could pivot or do them all at once rather one location at a time.  -0.5

A worktable approach, though.

PART 5:
Similar feedback.  The loop works, but a join would have beem most appropriate.  -0.5

PART 6:
Good thought process here.  I think your observation that there are a lot of other factors is important.  I sould suggest that one pattern you might see is that larger / more dense counties never have a longer doubling time than smaller areas.
