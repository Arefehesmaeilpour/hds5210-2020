# Midterm Feedback

## Overall Score: 
46 / 50

Well done overall.  One thing that I was looking for was for everyone to write some reausable code rather than doing the same logic over and over again.  (-1)  You can see what I mean in the video review of the midterm.


## Part 1: Creating a JSON Rules File
Comments - Well done!  The way you handled the two different types of renal failure works very nicely.

## Part 2: Functions to evaluate rules

### 2A-E Age, Temperature, Pressure, HeartRate, Respiratory Rate
Comments - Nicely done.

### 2F Organ Failure History
Comments - Nicely done.

### 2G FiO2
Comments - The logic you had built into JSON would have been usable here for the FiO2 ranges.  So, adding the logic for 0-50 or >50 was unnecessary here.  (-1)

### 2H-K Potassium, Sodium, Hematocrit, WBC
Comments - Nicely done.

### 2L Glasgow
Comments - Interesting choice to put it in the JSON instead of just doing 15-, but I like it.  It provides flexibility!

### 2M Creatinine
Comments - Nicely done.

## Part 3: Put it all together
Comments - Piece of cake!  Nice work.


## Part 4: Accessing and processing the patient file
Comments - Well done use of iterrows.  I was looking for code to compare your scores with the provided answers, though.  (-2)
